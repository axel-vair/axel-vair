👋 **Hi, I’m @axel-vair**

* 👀 I’m interested in front-end but more broadly in web coding :)
* 🌱 I’m currently learning web coding and becoming, I hope very soon, front-end developper. 
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a company to learn how to become a dev web and learn new programming languages. 

* 📫 You can send me an email here : axel.vair@laplateforme.io
