- 👋 Hi, I’m @axel-vair
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end but more broadly in web coding :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web coding and become, I hope very soon, front-end developper. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with an company for learning how to become dev web and learn new programming languages.
